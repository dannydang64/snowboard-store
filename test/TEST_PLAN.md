| Performance variations | High | Medium | Use relative thresholds and average multiple measurements |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | High | Test across multiple browsers and use feature detection |
| API changes breaking tests | Medium | High | Implement version checking and flexible API validation |

### 10.2 Mitigation Strategies

- **Robust Wait Mechanisms**: Avoid timing-dependent failures
- **Test Independence**: Ensure tests can run in isolation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging
- **Screenshot Capture**: Capture screenshots on test failures
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance baselines for comparison
